- Steps to reproduce the vulnerability (if known)
- Potential impact
- Any recommended or suggested fix

## Response Time

- We aim to **acknowledge** your report within **2 business days**.
- We’ll investigate promptly. If the vulnerability is confirmed, we’ll either:
  - Provide a **planned fix** timeline, or
  - Issue a **hotfix** release if it’s critical.

## Disclosure

We’ll coordinate with you on a **responsible disclosure** timeline. Typically, we:

1. Verify and fix the issue.
2. Release a patched version.
3. Publicly disclose (with your credit, if desired) after the fix is available.

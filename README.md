# My Christmas Project

An unusual, software-engineer-themed telling of the night before Christmas, built with Node.js and ready for a Dev Container.

## Getting Started

1. Open this project in VS Code.
2. Use the "Remote - Containers" extension to open the folder in a dev container.
3. Once inside the container, run `npm start` in the integrated terminal.

## Easter Eggs

- **RUN_EASTER_EGG**: Set this environment variable to `true` before running to see a special message.
  ```bash
  RUN_EASTER_EGG=true npm start

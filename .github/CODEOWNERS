# Example CODEOWNERS File
# Place at: .github/CODEOWNERS or CODEOWNERS in the repo root

# Each line: 'pattern'   'github username or team'

# 1) Mark as the default owner for entire repo
# This means any file that doesn't match more specific rules below
# will automatically request Mark for review
* @markcoleman

# 2) Specific ownership for certain directories/files
# For example, if we have an npm project in /src, we might do:
src/ @markcoleman

# If you have multiple owners for a directory:
# src/frontend/ @markcoleman @some-other-user

# 3) Specific ownership for GitHub Actions workflows
.github/workflows/ @markcoleman

# 4) For a doc directory
docs/ @markcoleman

# If you want to exclude or override certain files, do more specific patterns above
# e.g.: "package.json" @markcoleman
